# Trippy-Delegates
Some really trippy delegates implementations in C and C++ that I did for fun. This does not deserve to exist. Literally posted just because a friend asked for this, please forgive me for these crimes against humanity.

TODO: add some single function delegates that perform no dynamic allocations, and rename the current delegates to multi-cast delegates. This way I get the best of both worlds, or something.
